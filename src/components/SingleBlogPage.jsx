<p>Your website is the most crucial marketing tool you have. It is the first thing your customer will visit if they are considering your brand, making it a means of your sales at all hours of the day. 
Your website will leave a mark on the people visiting it. The impact it makes can be both positive and negative. This impact is dependent on several various factors, the most crucial one of these is the UI/UX design of your website. 
User interface and user experience are the two most significant features in determining how well your website ranks. We all want to make sure that the people who visit our website stay for as long as possible, explore all the areas, and even make purchases if they are available, this can be done with the help of several different ways. One such way is improving the user experience and user interface when people visit your site. 
Everyone wants their website to not only look welcoming but also have elements that impress the visitor. The UI/UX design of your website is focused on improving the quality of design and making your website get to the mark of user satisfaction. The main purpose of UI/UX designing is to make a website user friendly and easy enough to operate while also providing visual satisfaction to the user as well. 
Here are some tips that you can follow to make your design more UI/UX friendly. </p>

<h2>1.	Do proper user research:</h2>
<p>The most essential thing to remember when you search for improving your UI/UX design is to understand what your users need. 
The website you are developing is for users, so even before you get to the stage of working on what you need to do, you need to ask yourself who you are doing it for? 
A general rule of thumb is identifying your target audience. Is your website for teens, adults, women, men or any other specification that might set your website apart from the rest. Understanding who will be most likely to visit your website is crucial because it will help you narrow down your research and work on developing a better UI/UX design. 
Having a narrowed down niche will also help you design a UI/UX theme that is free from clutter and mess-making it clearer to use. 
If you are having issues understanding your target audience, one thing you can do is run statistics of what kind of work you are doing. If you have social media presence for the product you are endorsing on your website then check out the stats of what type of people visit your pages regularly, what are their needs, and what category they fall under. You can also conduct surveys to get voting from the public. If you are still unclear, a simple google search is your best friend. Take advantage of this and gather up an idea of what kind of people could be your future customers. 

<h2>2.	Simplicity is key:</h2>
Many times, when we are trying to develop a website that would fit the needs of the user, we forget about the importance of simplicity. 
A simple design goes a long way in making sure that you have a website that is easy to use and straightforward to navigate and understand. 
Simplicity in UI/UX design means making sure that your website is easy enough to operate and contents can be accessed without fuss. No one likes to visit a website that is hard to access. If someone comes to your website and does not find what they are looking for in the next few minutes, they are most likely to leave. To make sure your visitors stay for longer and also enjoy your website, you must build a design that has all the features that make it simple yet elegant. 
Simplicity means you make a design that is clean and polished. It should contain about 3 to 4 colours that are easy on the eye and at most, three fonts. 

<h2>3.	Use whitespace generously:</h2>
<p>One of the simplest yet most effective ways of improving the UI/UX design of your website is by using tons of whitespace. 
Whitespace provides many functions and purposes. It makes your design look more elegant and polished. It helps the user navigate your website more easily and quickly. 
Whitespace will make sure your design stands out while staying neat and sophisticated. 
You can use whitespace as much as you wish in your design because it will only make your structure more intricate and easier to use for the person visiting your website. 
</p>
<h2>4.	Work on element placement:</h2>
<p>When talking about making a website easy to navigate, you need to comprehend element placement. 
Your design should not only be easy enough to navigate, but it should also have all the elements placed without any fuss. This means a user cleanse website should be able to find what they are looking for without having to spend hours searching. 
One way to make sure that your user finds it easier to navigate your website is by working on element placement. Meaning-making important points on your website are visually distinct and at times, even striking. 
Make sure you choose a colour theme that is not only elegant and easy on the eyes, but it should also have colours that highlight important points on your website. 
</p>
<h2>5.	Consistency should be your top priority:</h2>
<p>When we are talking about design, consistency means making sure your website is easy to follow. 
A user who ends up on your website will be coming there with a specific goal. To make sure that a user has a satisfactory experience while navigating through your website to search for their final destination, you need to design a consistent layout. 
Your website should follow a similar pattern and it should be clean and easy to understand. Each step that a user takes when on your website should land him or her to the end goal. 
To make sure this happens, you need to get into the mind of the user and think like one. Understand what your customers are looking for and design a layout that frees from fuss and complications. 
</p>
<h2>6.	Focus on user feedback:</h2>
<p>What better way to understand how difficult or easy it is to navigate your website than to get feedback from the users themselves. 
Many websites leave a section for user feedback to get a review on the experience of the people who visit them. This is a great way to understand how your website is reviewed and presented. 
The most important feedback on your website is not of yours or the designer, it is the response of your customers that determine where your website stands which is why it is crucial to understand how you can improve the user experience. To understand this, there is no better person to consult on your website than the user. 
</p>
<h2>7.	The loading time of your page:</h2>
<p>The loading time of your website is another factor that plays an important role in making sure your website is user friendly and interactive. 
If your website takes a long time to load up all the available features then there is a good chance that the user will leave without waiting. So, make sure you design your website based on understanding the loading time of various elements on your page. 
Having popped up messages and animations on your website is a factor that can reduce the number of people who visit and it also makes your website unappealing and at times, harder to navigate. This can add up to an overall bad user experience which will make people reluctant to visit your website more frequently. 
</p>
<h2>8.	Your website should be mobile-friendly:</h2>
<p>Often forgets about the importance of making their website mobile-friendly. 
Making sure your website is mobile-friendly is imperative. The reason why is because people have started using their phones for many of the tasks they used to perform on computers. Website browsing is one of those tasks. Chances are, you are reading this article on your mobile phone as well. This should make you understand the importance of making your website mobile-friendly. 
More than half of the people who visit your website will do so on their phones, so if your website is not mobile-friendly then most of the people won't bother firing up a laptop to check out your content, they will instead find another website. 
So, make sure your website is optimised in a way that it can be easily used on the phone as well as on a desktop.
</p>
<h2>9.	Keep your content spot-on:</h2>
<p>This should go without saying. Your content is your seller. An elegant and sophisticated UI/UX design will not do you any good if you do not have the right content to live up to your expectations. 
When designing the UI/UX content on your website, make sure you use content that sells. Add heading and statements that will make a user stop and ponder over your services. 
Not only are your words important but so are the images and illustrations that you use on your website that make an impact on the user. Your images should go with the theme of your design and should blend into your website without any fuss. 
Furthermore, your content should be clean, effective and free from jargon. 
</p>
<h2>10.	Develop a creative call to action:</h2>
<p>The main purpose of your website is to sell. Be it your story or your services, it is unavoidable to make sure you make sales happen while staying consistent and true to your design. 
Your user will not want a pop-up message urging them to buy your services nor will they want the buying option to be so hidden that your user just gives up on looking for it. 
You need to be clever with developing your call to action. It should be easily visible and it should be consistent with your theme and the flow of your website. 
</p>
Your website is your number one selling point. Whether you have a personal blog or own a company, you have to make a website design and layout that will implore your users to not only frequently visit your site, but also buy your services. This will only be possible when you develop a UI/UX design that is easy to use and operate while also maintaining a beautiful and simple design.
