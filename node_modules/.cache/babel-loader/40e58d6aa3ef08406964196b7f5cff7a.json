This can add up to an overall bad user experience which will make people reluctant to visit your website more frequently. \n</p>\n<h2>8.\tYour website should be mobile-friendly:</h2>\n<p>Often forgets about the importance of making their website mobile-friendly. \nMaking sure your website is mobile-friendly is imperative. The reason why is because people have started using their phones for many of the tasks they used to perform on computers. Website browsing is one of those tasks. Chances are, you are reading this article on your mobile phone as well. This should make you understand the importance of making your website mobile-friendly. \nMore than half of the people who visit your website will do so on their phones, so if your website is not mobile-friendly then most of the people won't bother firing up a laptop to check out your content, they will instead find another website. \nSo, make sure your website is optimised in a way that it can be easily used on the phone as well as on a desktop.\n</p>\n<h2>9.\tKeep your content spot-on:</h2>\n<p>This should go without saying. Your content is your seller. An elegant and sophisticated UI/UX design will not do you any good if you do not have the right content to live up to your expectations. \nWhen designing the UI/UX content on your website, make sure you use content that sells. Add heading and statements that will make a user stop and ponder over your services. \nNot only are your words important but so are the images and illustrations that you use on your website that make an impact on the user. Your images should go with the theme of your design and should blend into your website without any fuss. \nFurthermore, your content should be clean, effective and free from jargon. \n</p>\n<h2>10.\tDevelop a creative call to action:</h2>\n<p>The main purpose of your website is to sell. Be it your story or your services, it is unavoidable to make sure you make sales happen while staying consistent and true to your design. \nYour user will not want a pop-up message urging them to buy your services nor will they want the buying option to be so hidden that your user just gives up on looking for it. \nYou need to be clever with developing your call to action. It should be easily visible and it should be consistent with your theme and the flow of your website. \n</p>\nYour website is your number one selling point. Whether you have a personal blog or own a company, you have to make a website design and layout that will implore your users to not only frequently visit your site, but also buy your services. This will only be possible when you develop a UI/UX design that is easy to use and operate while also maintaining a beautiful and simple design. \n</p>\n                        <hr />\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"writtenRow\">\n                        <p>Written by</p>\n                        <img src=\"/assets/images/logo2.png\" alt=\"xharptech-logo\" />\n                    </div>\n                    <div className=\"row blogsRow\">\n                        <div className=\"blogs\">\n                        <h2>BLOG POSTS</h2>\n                            <h1>Don't miss out our more Blogs</h1>\n                            <p>From technology to digitalization, we have got everything for you</p>\n                            <div className=\"posts\">\n                                <div className=\"container-fluid\">\n                                    <div className=\"row\">\n                                        <div className=\"col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-12\">\n                                            <PostTeaser />\n                                        </div>\n                                        <div className=\"col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-12\">\n                                            <PostTeaser2 />\n                                        </div>\n                                        <div className=\"col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-12\">\n                                            <PostTeaser1 />\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <ContactEmail />\n            <Footer />\n        </>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default SingleBlogPage"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
